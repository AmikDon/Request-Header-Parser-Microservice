# Request-Header-Parser-Microservice

Just trying out a simple backend project using node.js as a test on freecodecamp.org where the tasks below are carried out:

--  A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your IP address in the ipaddress key.

--  A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your preferred language in the language key.

--  A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your software in the software key.
